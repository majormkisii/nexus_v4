# Tool Utilities

This folder contains general-purpose **helper scripts and utilities** for development tasks in Nexus.  
Examples include environment setup, code formatting, linting, and housekeeping scripts.

## Purpose
- Automate common developer workflows.  
- Enforce code quality and consistency.  
- Support other tools (scaffold, deploy, generate, migrations) with reusable helpers.

## Examples
- `env_setup.sh` → setup local development environment.  
- `lint.sh` → run linters across SDKs, apps, and services.  
- `format.py` → auto-format source code according to standards.

## Notes
- Keep utilities modular and documented.  
- Encourage usage in CI/CD pipelines and local developer setups.
