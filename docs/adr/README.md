# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Nexus platform, following the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.  
Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision, the context, alternatives considered, and the chosen approach.  
ADRs provide a historical record of decisions and rationale to help maintain consistency as the platform evolves.
