## **Next Steps**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Local Development

* Follow the **first-week coding checklist** to get the MVP running on your laptop.
* Focus on **local-first**, minimal cloud usage.
* Aim for the **end-to-end workflow**: login ‚Üí chat ‚Üí AI response ‚Üí display ‚Üí store.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental MVP Expansion

Once the core flow works locally:

* Add SDKs for other languages (Go, Rust, Java).
* Expand AI Service with more Hugging Face models or local embeddings.
* Begin integrating the **Marketplace Service** for plugins/tools.
* Improve frontend UX with Tailwind components, chat history, and simple dashboards.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD & DevOps

* Set up **GitHub Actions** for linting, testing, and build checks.
* Ensure **Docker Compose** reliably spins up all services.
* Optionally experiment with **local Kubernetes (k3d/minikube)** to simulate cloud deployment.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Architecture

* Populate `docs/adr/` with architecture decisions as you go.
* Update `docs/api/openapi.yaml` as endpoints evolve.
* Add diagrams to `docs/architecture/diagrams` for microservice flows and data models.
* Keep `TODO.md` and `README.md` up to date.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Iterative Public Demo / Beta

Once the local MVP is solid:

* Deploy frontend + API Gateway to free-tier cloud (Vercel, Fly.io, Render).
* Keep AI Service local at first, then explore cloud hosting when cost allows.
* Gather feedback from potential users (developers + SMBs).
* Expand AI workflows, composability, and multi-cloud readiness.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Longer-Term / Scaling

* Replace local vector DB with optional cloud-backed Chroma or Weaviate.
* Add AI-first UX improvements (Copilot for configuring services, workflows).
* Implement marketplace extensions fully.
* Add enterprise-focused features: multi-tenancy, RBAC, analytics dashboards.
