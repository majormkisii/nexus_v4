# Test Utilities

This folder contains **helper functions, fixtures, and reusable utilities** for the Nexus platform’s tests.  
It supports unit, integration, and end-to-end tests by providing common setup, teardown, and mock functionality.

## Purpose
- Provide shared fixtures for services, SDKs, and apps.  
- Include mock data, test helpers, and common assertions.  
- Reduce code duplication and maintain consistency across all tests.

## Guidelines
1. Keep utilities **general-purpose** and independent of specific tests.  
2. Document each utility function clearly for easy reuse.  
3. Organize fixtures by service, library, or SDK to maintain clarity.  
4. Avoid hardcoding environment-specific values; leverage `.env.example` or configuration files.

## Examples
- `mock_api_client.py` → mocks API Gateway requests.  
- `test_fixtures.py` → provides reusable database and service setup/teardown.  
- `helpers.js` → JavaScript/TypeScript test utilities for SDKs.

## Notes
- Test utilities are critical for **efficient, maintainable, and reliable testing**.  
- Ensure that changes to utils do not break dependent tests.  
- Include unit tests for key utility functions when applicable.
